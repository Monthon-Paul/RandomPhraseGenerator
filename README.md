# RandomPhraseGenerator
Random Phrase Generator generates a grammarly structure phrase from a .g file. It was a Comprehensive assignment for my CS 2420 Data Structures & Algorithm course. I completed it with a partner & finalize the solution to implement a recursive call for the final project.

The program uses Hashmaps, Arrays, & recursion throughout building the algorithm. the Final time complexity for the program would result in O(n). Where N times of generating non-terminals with sets on only one production String & take N times as reading per line.
